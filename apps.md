Hugin can be used to [combine images taken at different exposures](https://redd.it/4o4c9r) into one HDR photo, even when a tripod wasnt used during shooting.  It can be used to [combine multiple astrophotography images to reduce noise](https://redd.it/51v5kt), when the world has turned and the stars have moved. By taking two pictures, and moving your body you can easily [remove your big thumb](https://redd.it/4q2oyr) from a photo.  It can also be [used to print out a picture](https://redd.it/4o4e7h) that with scissors and glue can be made into a 360 ball.
